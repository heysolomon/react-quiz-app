# React Quiz App 
In this project, I developed a test application to measure your English vocabulary for all levels using React Hooks and HTML&CSS. In the application, there is a 20-question word test for each level of English A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

Each question in the test is shown one by one. You have 30 seconds to answer the question. Within 30 seconds, you must mark one of the options given in the question and move on to the next question. If you do not answer the question until the time is up, your answer will be automatically blank and you will move on to the next question.

You can see your progress in the test. When the test is over, you can see how many percent you answered the test correctly. You can check the accuracy of all your answers. You can find out the correct answer by finding the question you answered incorrectly. You can solve the test in each level.

You can test yourself and improve your English by solving the tests in order from easy to difficult.

Tests on different topics and subjects can be added to the project.
